# Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of a disease (diabetes) based on patient health data. It applies a Random Forest classifier to identify patterns in patient features and determine if they have the disease or not.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the Diabetes dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing features such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, age, and more.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling  
- Model training using Random Forest classifier  
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Prediction on new patient data

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
